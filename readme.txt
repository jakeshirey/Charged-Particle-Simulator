It will automatically start with two oppositely charge particles in a binary orbit. 

Controls:
Left Click - Drop positive charge (Red)
Right Click - Drop negative charge (Blue)
Space - Pause/Play simulation
X - Delete all particles
Z - Delete last particle (like an undo button)
R - Sets all particles' velocities to zero, simulation keeps going after (this is a fun one to spam)
G - Turn on/off gravity (simple overall gravitational field, not gravity between objects)
S -  Turn on/off locked charge dropping. Locked charges do not move, and are denoted by orange for positive, purple for negative. You still must click to drop the charge, and press S again to go back to dropping moveable charges.
