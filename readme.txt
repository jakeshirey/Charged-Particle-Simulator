This is the charged particle simulator I've been writing over the past two weeks, finished to the point of satisfaction. I've included the .exe file if you just want to run it, and the source code if you want to tweak it to your liking. It will automatically start with two oppositely charge particles in a binary orbit. 

Controls:
Left Click - Drop positive charge (Red)
Right Click - Drop negative charge (Blue)
Space - Pause/Play simulation
X - Delete all particles
Z - Delete last particle (like an undo button)
R - Sets all particles' velocities to zero, simulation keeps going after (this is a fun one to spam)
G - Turn on/off gravity (simple overall gravitational field, not gravity between objects)
S -  Turn on/off locked charge dropping. Locked charges do not move, and are denoted by orange for positive, purple for negative. You still must click to drop the charge, and press S again to go back to dropping moveable charges.

When you download the .exe file off the shared google drive folder your PC will probably tweak out and think it is a virus (this is because most random .exe files on the internet are). I promise you this is not a virus, just skip past that part.
Have Fun!
